# Misen developer assessment

## Background

Misen started with a Kickstarter project for our chef’s knife, and we’ve continued to run Kickstarter projects for major project launches. The aims of this project are to 1. bring elements of the community-focused experience of Kickstarter to our site and 2. provide a venue for customer feedback and more direct interaction with our product team.

For more context, take a look at our [Kickstarter campaigns](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/misenkitchen/created) and the [Misen Labs](https://misen.com/pages/misen-labs) sction of our site.

## Brief

For this assessment, please write a few paragraphs outlinong an approach for building a site with the following features, taking note of any obstacles or challenges in implementing these features:

1. Scheduled livestreamed video events
2. Posts about new products

### Scheduled livestreamed video events

This should include a live chat component, as well as a signup form to receive email alerts when a stream is scheduled. Consider how the video would integrate with the site, particularly how we might display content that would allow the user to purchase or preorder items during the stream.

### Posts about new products

These posts will require verified user accounts to view most of the content. The goal of these posts is to solicit customer feedback in an initial survey, followed by a more open-ended comment section where users and the product team can comment and discuss the products featured in the post.

## Notes

This is a vaguely-outlined project with a broad set of goals; there is no “right answer” to this assessment. Your response will be evaluated based on the thought process in approaching this project and recognizing obstacles and pain points in implementing these features.

Don’t worry about technical infrastructure as much, but assume that this site will not use our current infrastructure (namely, Shopify), and that that also presents a challenge in that it will be built separately from our current ecommerce site.
